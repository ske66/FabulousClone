# FabulousClone
Clone of the Fabulous App Sign Up page in Xamarin Forms using Xamarin Forms, Prism, SQLite-net-pcl, and Rg.Popups.

It uses a fully fledged MVVM architecture along with service injection and the repository pattern. In my mind it is a decent project that could be scaled to showcase more complex scenarios. The overall design of the app is very corporate and encourages testability, seperation of concerns, and general readability. I am open to suggestions on how to improve or restructure my app. I have been developing in a closed environment for over a year so this is how I have learned to develop Xamarin Apps
